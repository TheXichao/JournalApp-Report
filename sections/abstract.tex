\chapter{Abstract}
This project describes the development of a full-stack journal application following an iterative approach. The app encompasses a Django Server controlling a PostgreSQL database, a React frontend that communicates with the server through RESTful APIs exposed by the Django server. 

This is the first time I have committed to developing a full-stack application, and I have learned a lot about the process of developing a full-stack web application. I have learned how to use the Django REST framework to create APIs with Python and how to use React to create a dynamic Frontend with TypeScript. 

During my development, I have regularly made commits to my git repositories. This is a new Github repository containing the source code of both my Backend and Frontend: \url{https://github.com/TheXichao/JournalApp-NEA/}
